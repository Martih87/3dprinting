# 3D Printing Space Monitoring Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for a 3D printing space monitoring system. The system uses two Raspberry Pis, one equipped with a Pi Camera and the other with a Sense HAT, to monitor the 3D printing process.

## Project Idea

The idea behind this project is to create a reliable and efficient monitoring system for 3D printing spaces. By using Raspberry Pis, we can create a cost-effective solution that provides real-time monitoring and data collection. This system can help in identifying potential issues early, ensuring the smooth operation of the 3D printing process.

## Monitoring Apps

### Pi Camera App

This app uses the Pi Camera module to capture real-time video of the 3D printing process. This can be used to visually monitor the process and identify any issues that may arise.

### Sense HAT App

The Sense HAT app collects environmental data from the 3D printing space, such as temperature and humidity. This data can be used to ensure the optimal conditions for 3D printing are maintained.

## Setup

Detailed instructions on how to set up the Raspberry Pis and the monitoring apps are provided in the [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md).

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the monitoring system and the apps are provided in the [User Guide](./USAGE.md).
